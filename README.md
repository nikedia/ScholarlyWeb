### Things to take note

- Scholarly's website is built upon __Angular 5__. Please contribute using proper __Angular 5__ code.
- Scholarly's CSS Framework is __MaterializeCSS__. Please contribute using proper __MaterializeCSS__ syntax.
- You can change how the styling looks without __MaterializeCSS__, but please stick as close to __MaterializeCSS__ as possible.

### Generating components

Run `ng g component <Component Name>` to generate a new component.

Help:
- `g` is short for `generate`.
- Components are __not__ only pages. You can create __Navbars, Widgets and etc__ with it.
